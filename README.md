## Description
This is mod for getting data from shops on Blockcafe Minecraft server.
Currently extracts data only from shops in russian or english language.
Also thats my first try at minecraft modding so there is quite a bit of questionable code. Any help in development would be appriciated.
## How to use
Download and install mod as you would any other fabric mod. Write command /getSigns \[\<radius\>\] in chat. Mod will search for shops in specified block radius from the player and output found shops in **Catalogue.csv** file.
## To-Do
- Find a way to translate item names extracted from shops
- Find a way to process signs in any language
- add a command that would search area for a shop with specified item
- add more options for output format
